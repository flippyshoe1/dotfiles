### dotfiles - everything *i* need for my computer use
dotfiles that suit my needs, caters towards linux (and more unix based operating systems in the future)\
at this moment i make the assertion you are running debian (arch will exist later)\
(also i have not tested it on debian **based** distros thus i cannot guarantee it will work)

to sort out everything automatically after you cloned the repo
```bash
./setup.sh
```
be sure to follow every input prompt it gives\
also it escalates privileges for the package manager so be wary of that\
check out the source code to make sure nothing is... bad, y'know?
