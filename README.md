### dotfiles - everything *i* need for my computer use
dotfiles that suit my needs, caters towards linux (and hopefully more unix based operating systems in the future)\
at this moment i make the assertion you are running debian (arch support will be added later)\
(also i have not tested it on debian **based** distros thus i cannot guarantee it will work)

to sort out everything automatically after you cloned the repo
```bash
./setup.sh
```
be sure to follow every input prompt it gives\
also it escalates privileges for the package manager so be wary of that\
check out its source code to make sure nothing is... bad, y'know? (not saying i injected anything, but good practice is good practice)
